# Linear Regression
• Linear regression using Normal Equation Solution, Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent, was implemented using python.
•  For the given data, the model built using gradient descent has the minimum RMSE for the testing data.
• Used Python Libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib.
# Polynomial Regression with Regularization
• Polynomial regression (with degrees varying from 1 2, . ., 10) using Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent backed up by Lasso and Ridge regularization, was implemented using python.
• For the given data, the model built using 9 degree polynomial and Ridge SGD with regularization parameter 0.75, had the maximum Accuracy for the validation set.
• Used Python Libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib , mpltoolkits.mplot3d and sklearn.preprocessing
